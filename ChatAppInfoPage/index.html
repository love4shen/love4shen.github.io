The ultimate goal is to enhance connection between 2 persons, that's the reason for the minimalist design of the UI. I do not offer lots of other 'fancy', 'seem-useful', 'may-be-used-once-or-twice' features like image filtering, sending money, boucing effects when pulling down the chat log. I will keep enhancing communication, stability and security, but not aimlessly adding new hot functionality to Chatt. Go back to the very inital state, just you and h*, connected.</p><img src="public/images/IMG_1010.jpg" class="img-responsive"><img src="public/images/IMG_1010.jpg" class="img-responsive"></div><hr class="divider"></section><section id="section_whyme"><p>why Chatt?
